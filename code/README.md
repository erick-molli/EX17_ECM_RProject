# EX17_data analysis code

The data analysis code should run smoothly if all the raw data files are in place and all packages are run at the beginning.

The code is divided in 4 sections:

1.Demographic characteristics: Descriptive statistics for the sample population and summaries.
2.PM2.5 Concentrations: The summary statistics for the PM2.5 concentrations.
3.ECM Comparisons: The main analysis for the gravimetric and nephelometric comparisons, which includes Spearman correlations, Bland-Altman agreement, ICC and RMSE.
4.Percentiles: Additional analyses requested by the journal editors, added to the Supplement.
